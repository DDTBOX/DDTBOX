DOI: (as above)\r\n\r\n# External Dependencies\r\n\r\nThe code in the toolbox depends on the functionality supplied by [LIBSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).\r\nIn the future, we hope to offer support for LIBSVM's specialised and often faster cousin, [LIBLINEAR](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/), as well as potentially other backends for other classifiers. \r\nYou need to configure MATLAB to use these external dependencies.\r\nPlease see their respective documentation for more information. \r\n",
