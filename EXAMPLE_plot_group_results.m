%
% This script is used for plotting group-level results of 
% classifier accuracy/SVR performance and feature weights analyses.
% Group-level statistical analyses must be performed before running this script.
%
% This script calls display_group_results_erp and
% display_feature_weights_results, both of which are included in DDTBOX.
